## Anchor CMS Themes

This Repo is solely for the development of Themes for the Open-Source Blogging CMS: Anchor.

This repo contains the default and boilerplate themes, this should provide you with enough aid to create your own themes.

Please use them as a template, but make sure that you duplicate them and do not overwrite them.

If you unsure about how to do something, [check out the docs!](http://anchorcms.com/docs)

You can also view a range of themes at [Anchor Themes](http://anchorthemes.com)
